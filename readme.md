### Description:

1. Bank Class
The Bank class will manage accounts using a LinkedHashMap equivalent in JavaScript, which is a Map object.

2. Account Class and Interfaces
We'll have an Account class which will be extended by CommercialAccount and ConsumerAccount.

3. CommercialAccount Class
Extends Account and adds authorized users functionality.

4. ConsumerAccount Class
This class represents a consumer account and is simpler than CommercialAccount.

5. Transaction Class
Handles transactions for an account, which can either be a credit or debit.

6. Person and Company Classes
These represent the users of the accounts, either as an individual or a company.

7. Testing the System
To test the system, you could set up a few transactions and account creations.

This JavaScript project models the basic functionality described in the diagram: handling accounts, transactions, users (both persons and companies), and integrating methods to check balances, perform deposits, and withdrawals.
